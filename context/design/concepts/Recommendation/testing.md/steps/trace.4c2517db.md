# trace: Recommendation Principle Fulfilled

The principle of the `Recommendation` concept is: "after adding items to a user's library, generate personalized recommendations either through MusicBrainz queries, using LLM analysis to refine these. Users can provide feedback on these suggestions, which is incorporated into future recommendations for that specific user."

Here's a step-by-step trace demonstrating how this principle is fulfilled:

1. **User `Alice`'s library grows (simulated by a `sourceItem` for recommendation generation):**
   * Let's assume `Alice` has `Radiohead` in her "library" (or is viewing `Radiohead` as a source for recommendations). This `sourceItem` (e.g., `sourceArtistMBID_Radiohead`) acts as the initial context.

2. **Generate initial recommendations for `Alice` based on `Radiohead`:**
   * **Action**: `recommendationConcept.generate()` is called for `userId: "user:Alice"`, `sourceItem: "artist:radiohead-mbid-1"`, `amount: 3`.
   * **External Input (via syncs)**: This `generate` action receives `sourceItemMetadata` for `Radiohead` (containing genres like "Art Rock", "Alternative Rock") and `similarArtists` (e.g., `Muse`, `Pink Floyd`, `Coldplay`) from the `MusicBrainzAPI` concept.
   * **Internal Query**: The `generate` action implicitly calls `_getFeedbackHistory` for `Alice` from its own state. Initially, `Alice` has no feedback, so the history is empty.
   * **LLM Refinement**: The `generate` action constructs an LLM prompt using `Radiohead`'s metadata, similar artists, and `Alice`'s (empty) feedback history. The mock LLM returns `Muse`, `Pink Floyd`, and `Queen` as recommendations with reasoning and confidence scores.
   * **Effect**: Three new `RecommendationDoc` objects are stored in the `Recommendation.recommendations` collection for `Alice`, linking `Radiohead` to `Muse`, `Pink Floyd`, and `Queen`. Each has an initial `feedback: null`.

3. **`Alice` views recommendations and provides positive feedback for `Muse`:**
   * **Action**: `recommendationConcept.provideFeedback()` is called for `userId: "user:Alice"`, `recommendedItem: "artist:muse-mbid-3"`, `feedback: true`.
   * **Effect**: The `RecommendationDoc` for `Muse` (where `item2` is `Muse`'s MBID) in the database is updated. Its `feedback` field changes from `null` to `true`, and `createdAt` is updated.

4. **`Alice` views recommendations and provides negative feedback for `Pink Floyd`:**
   * **Action**: `recommendationConcept.provideFeedback()` is called for `userId: "user:Alice"`, `recommendedItem: "artist:pink-floyd-mbid-5"`, `feedback: false`.
   * **Effect**: The `RecommendationDoc` for `Pink Floyd` (where `item2` is `Pink Floyd`'s MBID) in the database is updated. Its `feedback` field changes from `null` to `false`, and `createdAt` is updated.

5. **Generate new recommendations for `Alice` based on `Radiohead` (feedback incorporated):**
   * **Action**: `recommendationConcept.generate()` is called again for `userId: "user:Alice"`, `sourceItem: "artist:radiohead-mbid-1"`, `amount: 3`.
   * **External Input (via syncs)**: Same as step 2.
   * **Internal Query**: The `generate` action now calls `_getFeedbackHistory` for `Alice`. This time, it retrieves the positive feedback for `Muse` and the negative feedback for `Pink Floyd`.
   * **LLM Refinement**: The LLM prompt now includes `Alice`'s feedback history. The LLM's goal is to learn from this. *In our mocked scenario, we use a pre-set response, but in a real LLM, it would ideally suggest new items that align with 'Muse' and avoid anything like 'Pink Floyd'*. For instance, if `Queen` was previously recommended with low confidence, the LLM might deprioritize it, or recommend `The Beatles` instead if there's an affinity with `Muse`. For simplicity in this trace, let's assume the LLM sticks to `Muse`, `Pink Floyd`, and `Queen` for generation, but the *retrieval* action will demonstrate the effect of feedback.
   * **Effect**: New `RecommendationDoc` objects *might* be created. If the LLM generates items that are already in the feedback history, those are filtered out. If new ones are generated, they are added.

6. **Retrieve recommendations for `Alice` (feedback influences retrieval order and exclusion):**
   * **Action**: `recommendationConcept.getRecommendations()` is called for `userId: "user:Alice"`, `item: "artist:radiohead-mbid-1"`, `amount: 2`.
   * **Effect**:
     * The concept queries its `Recommendation.recommendations` collection for `Alice`.
     * It identifies `Muse` (positive feedback), `Pink Floyd` (negative feedback), and `Queen` (no feedback).
     * It filters out `Pink Floyd` due to negative feedback.
     * It prioritizes `Muse` (positive feedback) over `Queen` (no feedback, potentially lower confidence).
     * The action returns `["artist:muse-mbid-3", "artist:queen-mbid-6"]`, fulfilling the principle of incorporating user feedback into future recommendations.

This trace demonstrates how the `Recommendation` concept, through its `generate`, `provideFeedback`, and `getRecommendations` actions, along with its internal state (`RecommendationDoc`) and interaction with an external LLM (simulated), fulfills its purpose and principle by providing personalized, feedback-refined music suggestions to users.
