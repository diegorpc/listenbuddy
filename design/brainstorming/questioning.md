# prompt: Why is the sky blue?

# my response:
blue light scatters better than red or orange rays of light, so despite the sun's light being technically multicolored, blue light is the one we see. when the sun is particularly far like during a sunset, since the distance to the sun is longer then the blue light scatters away and we see the orange light.
